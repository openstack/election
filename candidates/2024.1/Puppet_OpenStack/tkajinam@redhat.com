Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for the PTL role in Puppet OpenStack during
2024.1 cycle.

I'd like to list up a few focus points for the upcoming cycle.

 - Keep our CI healthy

 - Keep our modules concistent with updates in OpenStack component

 - Consider working on some modernization of our modules
  - Removal of validate_legacy is prioritized to adapt to new stdlib
  - We also have a few other topics we may work on but with lower prioeiry

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
