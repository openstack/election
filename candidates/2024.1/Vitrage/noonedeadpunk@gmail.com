Hi there,

I am still interested in keeping the Vitrage project alive, thus I want
to propose myself as a Project Team Leader for 2024.1 (Caracal) cycle.

While I can not promise active development of new features for the project,
I will focus on:

* Keeping CI jobs in adequate state
* Review incoming patches and gain interest in project amoung community
* Take care of project releasing
* Implement community goals
