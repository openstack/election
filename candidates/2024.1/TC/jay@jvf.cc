I am declaring my candidacy for a second term on the TC.

I've been working on OpenStack for almost 10 years, with primary focus being
on Ironic.

Last time I nominated myself for TC, I posted a long document reflecting how I
look at the landscape of OpenStack. If you want to know more about my approach
and ideology please reference that previous post. What I've learned in my
first term as a TC member is that approaches and ideology don't matter as much
as solving the problem in front of you.

I hope, with another year on the TC, to use the lessons I've learned in the
last year to be an effective member -- continuing to focus on doing what's
neccessary to ensure OpenStack is around a long time. That goal will require
us to continue to entice and welcome new contributors to the community.
Achieving that will remain my top priority next year.

Thanks for your consideration,
Jay Faulkner (JayF)
