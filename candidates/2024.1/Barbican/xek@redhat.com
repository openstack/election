Hello,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Barbican PTL for the next cycle.

I've been the Barbican PTL since the Antelope cycle and I would like to
continue to contribute in this role. In the upcoming Bobcat cycle, I'd
like to continue focus on Barbican maintanance and stability.

Thanks,
- Grzegorz Grasza (xek)
