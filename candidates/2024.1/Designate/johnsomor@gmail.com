Hello OpenStack community,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Designate for the Caracal 
cycle.

I would like to continue to support the Designate team for the Caracal
release. For the Bobact release, we have continued our code stability work
and have added support for SQLAlchemy 2.x. There has also been great work on
adding support for catalog zones (RFC 9432).

Thank you for your support and your consideration for Caracal,

Michael Johnson (johnsom)
