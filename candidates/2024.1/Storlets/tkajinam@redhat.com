Hi All,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets during 2024.1 cycle, to
continue my current PTL role for the next cycle.

The project is now very small and has not be much active. Our continuous focus
is to maintain CI and adapt to any changes in swift and dependencies, to keep
our software functional.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
