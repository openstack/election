Dear OpenStack Community,

I am writing to express my intention to run for the role of Project Team Lead
(PTL) for the OpenStack-Helm project in the upcoming election. My name is
Mohammed Naser, and I am eager to contribute my skills, experience, and passion
to lead this project forward.

With extensive experience with Kubernetes, I understand its importance in the
modern cloud ecosystem. I have been actively involved in numerous Kubernetes
projects, honing my expertise and contributing to this pivotal technology.

In addition to my Kubernetes expertise, I have advocated for integrating
Kubernetes more deeply into the OpenStack community. I believe in the power of
these two technologies combined and have consistently pushed for their synergy.

As PTL, I will focus on enhancing the stability and reliability of
OpenStack-Helm, easing the deployment and management of OpenStack environments
on Kubernetes. I am committed to fostering collaboration and open communication.

I believe in the power of open source and the importance of accessible,
reliable, and beneficial software for all users. I am excited about the
possibility of leading the OpenStack-Helm project and driving innovation in the
OpenStack ecosystem.

Thank you for considering my candidacy. I look forward to the opportunity to
serve as your PTL and contribute to the ongoing success of the OpenStack-Helm
project.

Best regards,
Mohammed Naser
