Hi,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of Blazar for the 2024.1
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue in this role.

We have various new features being developed for Blazar, such as extending
instance reservation to support flavors. I will keep working with the community
to deliver these improvements to make Blazar more useful.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
