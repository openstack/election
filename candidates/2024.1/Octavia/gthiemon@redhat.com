Hi,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Octavia PTL for the Caracal release.
I have been PTL since the Xena cycle and I want to continue to contribute to
this role.

For Caracal I would like that we continue our progress on new features such as
DPDK support, SR-IOV support, Active/Active support with BGP.
Internally, I would like to improve our DB-related code, I think we can have
more efficient DB queries.

Thanks for your consideration,

Gregory Thiemonge (gthiemonge)
