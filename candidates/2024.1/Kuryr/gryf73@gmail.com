Hello,

I would like to announce my candidacy to be the Kuryr PTL for the next
2024.1 (Caracal) cycle.

I've been Kuryr contributor since the Ussuri release and became core
reviewers member at the end of Victoria cycle. I'm also the PTL since
Antelope cycle.

In the upcoming 2024.1 cycle, I'd like to focus on Kuryr maintenance,
stability and compatibility with upcoming Kubernetes release.

Thanks,
Roman Dobosz (gryf)
