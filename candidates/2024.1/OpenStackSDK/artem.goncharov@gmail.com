Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

We have reached a promising stage where we can start generating code for
certain tools (OSC, Ansible-modules, RustSDK, etc) using OpenStackSDK as a
reference. There are multiple challenges ahead and I would like to continue
leading the development into the better future with reduced maintenance burden.
 
Thanks!
Artem
