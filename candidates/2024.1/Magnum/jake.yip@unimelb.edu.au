Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Magnum PTL for the 2024.1 Cycle.

I have been the PTL since the Antelope Cycle. During the Bobcat cycle, the team
has achieved the following:

* Kept Magnum up to date, with support for Fedora CoreOS 37 and Kubernetes 1.25

* Get team consensus to drop support for Kubernetes 1.23

* Review and test patches for Secure RBAC and ClusterAPI

For the 2024.1 cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Support the team to merge the ClusterAPI driver for Magnum. This is a big
  change and critical for Magnum's continued relevancy.

* Support the team to merge the Secure RBAC changes. Huge thanks to ricolin for
  proposing this.

* Remove features that the team has deprecated. Getting rid of stale code and
  out dated features improves cuts down on tech debt.

* Continue clean up on the documentation.

Regards,
Jake
