Hi All,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Keystone PTL.  Keystone is an
important project for OpenStack and I would like to help ensure things
keep moving forward.

I'm very much interested in the Secure RBAC effort and I want to make sure
that the Keystone project has everything it needs to support the greater
community pursue the completion of this goal.

Thanks,
- Douglas Mendiz√°bal (dmendiza[m])
