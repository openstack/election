Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

We are as close to R1.0 as never before. Main bunch of changes is there and we
are currently only polishing remainings and recovering compatibility for the
corner cases. Please help me complete this work and drive SDK/CLI further for
wider adoption and better usability.

Thanks!
Artem
