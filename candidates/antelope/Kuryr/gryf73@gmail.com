Hello,

I would like to announce my candidacy to be the Kuryr PTL for the next
Antelope cycle.

I've been Kuryr contributor since the Ussuri release and became core
reviewers member at the end of Victoria cycle.

In the upcoming Antelope cycle, I'd like to focus on Kuryr stability
and compatibility with upcoming Kubernetes release. Another thing
which I'd like to move forward is to eliminate Kuryr services
restarts.

Thanks,
Roman Dobosz (gryf)
