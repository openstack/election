Hello everyone: 

I would like to announce my candidacy for Trove PTL for the Antelope Cycle.

I have been PTL for the last cycle (Zed), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.

In the upcoming cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Improve docs

* Improve CI tests

* Improve usability and make it easier for people to start running Trove

Thank you for considering my candidacy.
