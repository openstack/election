Hi All,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets for the Antelope release
cycle, to continue my PTL role.

During the Zed cycle, we finally removed Python 2 support following the same in
Swift project. For this cycle we'll focus on stability and support for a new
runtime(Python 3.10) and operating systems (Ubuntu 22.04) so that users can
continue using Storletss with newer platforms.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
