Hi All,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Barbican PTL.

I have been closely working with some of the Barbican cores and contributors
on both Barbican and other OpenStack projects. I know that they are ready
to entrust me with this role, especially since Doug, the long-serving current
PTL, is going to be taking personal time off for the majority of the Antelope
release cycle.

Thanks,
- Grzegorz Grasza (xek)
