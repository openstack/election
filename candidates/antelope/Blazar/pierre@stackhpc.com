Hi,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of Blazar for the Antelope
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue in this role.

Though we had a quiet Zed cycle, we still have various improvements in the
pipeline and I want to help the community deliver them to make Blazar more
useful.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
