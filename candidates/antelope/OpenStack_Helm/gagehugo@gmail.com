Hello everyone,

I would like to continue serving as the OpenStack-Helm PTL for the
Antelope cycle.

We managed to complete a long-term goal in the Zed cycle of reducing
the number of repositories under the OpenStack-Helm umbrella that
were no longer used. The project as a whole has continued the work
to keep up-to-date with any changes around kubernetes and helm with
the help of several contributors. As PTL I would like to make sure
this work continues on to allow OpenStack-Helm to provide a stable
way to deploy OpenStack via Helm & Kubernetes.

Thank you!
