Friends and Colleagues,

I would like to submit my candidacy to serve as Ironic PTL for the Antelope
cycle.

To introduce myself, if we have not met, I'm Jay Faulkner. I've been building
and running Ironic off and on for eight years. In my career, I've seen and
helped Ironic run in a variety of ways: as a part of OnMetal – the first bare
metal public cloud, internal clouds that stretch the limits of our software,
and as an upstream contributor without any operational responsibilities.

First and foremost, my new employer, G-Research Open Source Software, has
agreed to prioritize my upstream work in Ironic and to support me if elected
as PTL. This means that the Ironic project will be able to have a leader with
minimal downstream responsibilities, able to be fully dedicated to helping
Ironic run smoothly.

One of the things I've appreciated about the Ironic community as it has evolved
is our ability to gain consensus due to a large amount of trust and shared
context. This makes the role of PTL in our community not one of power but
instead a role of service. That's why, if elected, I intend to maintain that
focus on service to the community and will dedicate my time to getting as much
of the invisible but necessary work done as possible.  My goal is to remove the
annoying bits and enable the rest of the community to keep improving Ironic.

Finally, I want to thank Iury: he’s been a great PTL in the last cycle, and I
know we’ll be in good hands if the community chooses to continue with his
leadership.

Thanks,
Jay Faulkner
