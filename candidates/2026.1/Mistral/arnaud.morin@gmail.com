Hello everyone,
I want to propose myself, Arnaud Morin from OVHcloud, as PTL for Mistral.

We, at OVHcloud, intensively use Mistral for internal purpose and don't want the
the project to be abandonned.
Our first goal is to maintain existing functionnalities and get rid of eventlet,
but I think we can do great things with Mistral, and improve it further more.
