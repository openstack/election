Hello OpenStack community,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Designate for the
2026.1 cycle.

I've been a Designate contributor for over a year and served as both PTL
and a core reviewer during the last cycle (2025.2).

My focus for the 2026.1 cycle will be to continue working on removing
eventlet and enhancing the scheduler and filters, as capacity allows.

Thank you for your support and your consideration for 2026.1,

Omer Schwartz (oschwart)
