Hello,

I am announcing my new candidacy for the PTL role for Nova and Placement.

Serving as PTL in the Flamingo cycle was both a rewarding and instructive
experience. It allowed me to learn the responsibilities and workload of the
role, build stronger connections across the community, and help contributors
move their work forward.

In the next cycle, I want to continue fostering a welcoming and collaborative
environment for all contributors.

I will continue and improve our efforts to enhance bug triage, reduce the
number of open bugs, and support timely reviews to help features progress
toward completion.

I am also eager to follow and participate in the Eventlet removal effort,
which began in Flamingo and represents a major step for OpenStack. This is
a particularly interesting challenge—not highly visible to most users,
but crucial for the long-term health, performance, and maintainability of
the project.

My main focus, and the most important thing to me, will remain ensuring
that Nova and Placement stay robust, maintainable, and aligned with our
users’ needs.

Thank you for your trust so far, I’d be happy to continue serving in
this role.

Thanks,
René
