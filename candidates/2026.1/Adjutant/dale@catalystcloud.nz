Hello,

I would like to nominate myself for candidancy for Adjutant PTL for the 2026.1
cycle.

We continue to use this project extensively at Catalyst Cloud and I was an
original contributor and reviewer to the project in its early years (2016).

I have been PTL for this project for many cycles and I will continue to keep
this project functional and relevant to those using it.


Thank you for your consideration,

Dale Smith
Catalyst Cloud
