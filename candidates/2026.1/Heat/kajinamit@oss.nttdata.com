Hello,


I'd like to nominate myself as PTL in Heat project for the 2026.1 cycle to
continue my PTL role.

In this cycle we managed to complete removing eventlet. In the next cycle I
propose that we continue working on stability improvement of heat, while we
also continue our priority on aligment with global direction of OpenStack.
Adding complete support for Python 3.13 may be one of the important work I
expect now.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
