Hello everyone,

This cycle I want to nominate for the role of PTL
for the Horizon project during the 2026.1 (Gazpacho) cycle.

In this cycle, I would like to focus on the following questions:
* Resolving old issues
* Resolving open questions from our users
* Speeding up merge request review
* Further path along the JS framework
* Improving the user experience in using Horizon.

And also helping new contributors in this project.

Thank you for your consideration.
