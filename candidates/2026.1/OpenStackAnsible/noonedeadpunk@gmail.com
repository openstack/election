Hey everyone!

This cycle I want to self-nominate again for the role of PTL
for the OpenStack-Ansible project during the 2026.1 (Gazpacho) cycle.

Last cycle along with regular activities on using fresh/latest versions
of software, we have unified approach on Apache Web server deployment
through introduction of a common httpd role. This solved couple of bugs
and deployment issues, as well as potentially solved conflicts between
components for metal deployments.

On top of that a lot of refactoring and stack modernization work has
happened, which should improve overall stability and performance.

So this cycle I want to keep the progress going on areas of CI/CD
coverage improvement, as well as staying on top of best practices to
ensure stability and security of deployments.

With that staying on top of supported platforms and software is always a
priority, as well as gradually improving supported use-cases and
documentation around the project.

Thank you for your consideration!
