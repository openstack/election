I'd like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for 2025.2 cycle.

I have been PTL for the last eight cycles (Y-F), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.

I'd like to focus on mentoring candidates for core reviewers, extending
CI coverage and better communication with community.
