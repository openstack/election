Hi All,


Here I'd like to nominate myself as PTL of Storlets during the 2026.1 cycle,
to continue my PTL role over the next cycle.

During this cycle we added a few new features like podman gateway driver so
that Storlets can be used in more use cases. For the next cycle we don't have
any planned new features at this moment so I propose we focus on stability
improvement.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
