Hello everyone,

I would like to propose my candidacy for the QA PTL role for the 2026.1 cycle.
I have previously served as QA PTL for multiple cycles, and I am ok to
continue and keep up with the necessary QA activities required for the
development cycle.

Please note that the QA team is looking for volunteers to take on this role.
It will be helpful, if anyone would like to help as a PTL or maintain QA
projects. In the meantime, I am here to ensure that everything remains active.
