Hi,

I would like to nominate myself for Octavia PTL for the Z release cycle.
I am the current PTL and I would like to continue to contribute to this role.

For the Z release, my plan for Octavia is to enable persistence in taskflow in
the amphorav2 driver, to start working on HTTP/3 support, to fix old known
issues (handling multiple subnets on the VIP port, fixing multiple subnets
issue on member ports).

Thanks for your consideration,

Gregory
