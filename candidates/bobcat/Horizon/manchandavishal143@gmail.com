I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Horizon for
the Bobcat cycle. In the Antelope cycle, we have focused
on improving horizon-integration job, bug fixes, and completed
horizon CI jobs migration to 2023.1 cycle runtime i.e.
ubuntu-focal->ubuntu-jammy nodeset and nodejs v16-> nodejs v18.

In the Bobcat cycle, My main focus will be on filling more feature gaps
[1] and closing more actions item from the previous ptg [2].
