Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for the PTL role in Puppet OpenStack, to
continue my PTL role for the Bobcat cycle.

For the recent few cycles we have successfully updated our modules to keep
them up-to-date with the OpenStack projects and underlying operating systems
(such as CentOS Stream 9 or Ubuntu 22.04).

I expect the next cycle would be a stable one compared to the past cycles
because of no major changes we are aware of now, and I'd like to focus more on
items to make our future maintenance easier

* Adapt to updates in each component
* Review status of our modules and remove unmaintained ones or implementations

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
