Hi All,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets to continue my PTL role
for the upcoming Bobncat release.

Because the project is currently small and has been stable for a while, our
current focus is to maintain CI and adapt to changes in swift as well as
dependent libraries. We also have a few potential improvements pending so I'm
hopimg we can complete some of these during this cycle.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
