Hello,

I would like to announce my candidacy to be the Kuryr PTL for the next
Bobcat cycle.

I've been Kuryr contributor since the Ussuri release and became core
reviewers member at the end of Victoria cycle. I'm also the PTL since
Antelope cycle.

In the upcoming Bobcat cycle, I'd like to focus on Kuryr maintanance,
stability and compatibility with upcoming Kubernetes release.

Thanks,
Roman Dobosz (gryf)
