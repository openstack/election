Friends and Colleagues,

I would like to submit my candidacy to serve as Ironic PTL for the 2023.2
cycle.

The Antelope cycle was a learning experience for me, but we have achieved
and are still achieving many of our goals. 

Some specific items I'm proud to have championed or accomplished include:

- Unmaintained bugfix branches from the last several years have been
  cleaned up, making Ironic less of a burden on the commons.
- Worked cross-project with members of the Nova team, working to make
  Ironic scale with Nova computes in a way more inline with how Nova
  expects their services to scale.
- Performing soft influencer work to try and get Ironic more in the
  spotlight. These efforts included running semi-weekly streams where
  I did live OSS work, including at times working through issues with
  other Ironic contributors. I also have been active on socials doing
  what I can to share the word about the good stuff we're doing.

Ironic continues to be a large part of the open source ecosystem, and
I'm excited at the chance to lead for another cycle.

Thanks,
Jay Faulkner
