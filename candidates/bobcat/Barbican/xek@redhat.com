Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy to be the Barbican PTL.

I've been the Barbican PTL since the Antelope cycle and I would like to
continue to contribute in this role. In the upcoming Bobcat cycle, I'd
like to focus on Barbican maintanance and stability.

Thank you for considering my candidacy,
 - Grzegorz Grasza (xek)
