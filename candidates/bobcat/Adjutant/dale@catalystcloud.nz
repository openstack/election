Hello,

I would like to nominate myself for candidancy for Adjutant PTL. We use this project extensively at Catalyst Cloud and I was an original contributor and reviewer to the project in its early years(2016).

I have been PTL for this project in the Antelope cycle and I aim to keep this project useful and relevant to those using it.


Thank you for your consideration,

Dale Smith
Catalyst Cloud
