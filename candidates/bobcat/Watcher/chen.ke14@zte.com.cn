Hi,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Watcher PTL for the
Bobcat cycle.

For the new cycle, we will continue to focus on the new architecture, performance
and stability.

Watcher provides a good architecture that can be flexibly adapted to various
energy-saving and consumption-reducing algorithms.

I hope that new contributors will join on the project.

Thanks,
Ke Chen (chenke)
