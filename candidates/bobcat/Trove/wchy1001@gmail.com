Hello,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Trove for the Bobcat
cycle.

I have been serving as the Trove PTL for 2 cycles and I would like
to continue serving as PTL to Trove project.

For the Antelope release, we spent most of the time improving the
CI and integrating with the Kolla project. These tasks haven't been
completed.

In the upcoming cycle, I will do my best to complete them.

thanks
wu.chunyang
