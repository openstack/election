Hello guys,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of CloudKitty for the Bobcat release cycle. I am the current PTL for the Antelope cycle and I am willing to continue in this role.

I will keep working with existing contributors to maintain CloudKitty for their use cases and encourage the addition of new functionalities.

Thank you for your support,
