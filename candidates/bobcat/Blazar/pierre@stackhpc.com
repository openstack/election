Hi,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of Blazar for the Bobcat
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue in this role.

We still have various improvements in progress and I want to help the community
deliver them to make Blazar more useful to the OpenStack community.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
