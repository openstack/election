Iâ€™d like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for Bobcat/2023.2 cycle.

I have been PTL for the last three cycles (Y, Z, A), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.
We've successfully expanded the core team, removed some maintenance burden
and improved the overall operator experience.
We've managed to add Rocky Linux 9 and Ubuntu 22.04 support across
all repositories (Kolla, Kolla-Ansible, Kayobe, ansible-collection-kolla).
I'd like to focus on further extending the core reviewers team and
continuing to improve user/operator experience.
