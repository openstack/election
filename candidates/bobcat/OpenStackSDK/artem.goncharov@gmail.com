Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

Now that SDK 1.0.0 is out to the wild it is time to start thinking about next
steps and ensuring OpenStack Client as well as Ansible collection OpenStack are
not forgotten. Main target for me is to further reduce amount of code we
maintain and invest as much as possible into auto-generation of the required
code.
 
Thanks!
Artem
