Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Magnum PTL for the Bobcat Cycle.

I have been the PTL for the Antelope Cycle. During this cycle, the team has
achieved the following:

* Removed most of Mesos code

* Kept Magnum up to date, with support for Fedora CoreOS 37 and Kubernetes 1.24

For the Bobcat cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Support the team to merge the ClusterAPI driver for Magnum. This is the top
  priority for Magnum to remain relevant in the long term.

* Drive the effort to remove more unsupported features and drivers. This is
  important for keeping the code base clean and makes tests easier.

* Improve testing to improve merge confidence and velocity.

* Clean up the documentation. Users have pointed out that the documentation is
  out of date and needs correction.

Being a first time PTL last cycle, I had a lot to learn. I am grateful to the
team and broader OpenStack contributors for showing me the way. Now that I am a
bit more experienced, I hope to be able to contribute with greater efficiency.
Therefore, I nominate myself for the PTL role in this cycle. Thank you for
considering my candidacy.

Regards,
Jake
