Hi all,

I would like to serve as the Venus PTL for the Bobcat Cycle.

I have been serving as the Venus PTL for Antelope cycle. I would
like to continue serving as PTL to this amazing community.

In the upcoming cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Continuous improvement in documents, unit tests, clients and dashboard.

* Support log exception detection.

Thank you for considering my candidacy.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Eric Zhang
