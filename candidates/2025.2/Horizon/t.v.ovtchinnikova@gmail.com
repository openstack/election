Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of the Horizon
project for the 2025.2 Flamingo cycle.

I have been PTL for this project for the last two cycles and I
would like to keep leading it, improving the functionality and 
stability.

For the Flamingo cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Continue working with feature gap
* Regular bug triage and grooming
* Involve more contributors into the community

Thank you for your consideration.
Tatiana Ovchinnikova (tmazur)
