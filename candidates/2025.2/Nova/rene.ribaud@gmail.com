Hello,

I would like to run for the PTL election for Nova and Placement.

I am fortunate to be employed by Red Hat to work on this project,
and I have been doing so for about three years. This means I am
quite familiar with the project's processes and codebase, though I
wouldn’t call myself an expert.

To be honest, I initially thought of becoming a core member before
running for this election. However, knowing that Sylvain wants to
step down, and after discussing it with him and other members of
the community, I realized that becoming PTL, while challenging,
is a viable path and a great opportunity.

I know this role will push me out of my comfort zone and require me
to work on areas where I have less experience. But I believe that
sometimes, growth comes from facing new challenges. So, I took a deep
breath and decided to write this message.

Regarding the future of the project, my goal is not to revolutionize
anything. I believe I will need some time to find my footing, and I
will do my best to continue in the direction that Sylvain has set. It
won’t always be easy, but I trust in the kindness of those involved
in this project to support me. I also rely on Sylvain’s mentoring,
as he proposed during his candidacy, to ensure a smooth transition.

One aspect I intend to be particularly mindful of is supporting
contributors in getting their code merged. Having recently merged a
major feature (virtiofs) that I carried for a long time, I know how
difficult and demanding the process can be—it requires a lot of
resilience. That’s why I'll pay attention to making this process
smoother and support contributors as effectively as I can.

Thanks,
René
