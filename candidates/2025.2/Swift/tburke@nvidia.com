I'd like to continue as Swift PTL.

We're at an exciting time for Swift: our largest-known deployments have
finally moved off of Python 2 (so we've finally shed that albatross!),
we've added a new core reviewer (the first since I've been PTL!), and I
feel like I've seen more new contributors recently than I have in a
while.

I look forward to seeing how Swift continues to evolve over the next
cycle.
