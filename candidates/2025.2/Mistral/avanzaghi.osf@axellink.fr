Hello everyone,
I want to propose myself, Axel Vanzaghi from OVHcloud, as PTL for Mistral again.

We, at OVHcloud, intensively use Mistral for internal purpose and don't want the
the project to be abandonned.
Our first goal is to maintain existing functionnalities, but I think we can do
great things with Mistral, and improve it further more.
