Hi all,

I would like to serve as the Venus PTL for the 2025.2 Cycle.

I have been serving as the developer for 5 cycles. I would
like to serving as PTL to this amazing community.

In the upcoming cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Continuous improvement in documents, unit tests, clients.

* Promote the implementation of corresponding functions for dashboard.

Thank you for considering my candidacy.

Thanks & Best Regards,
JIASIRUI
