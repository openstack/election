Hi,

I want to propose my candidacy and continue serving as Monasca PTL in the
new cycle 2025.2 release:

As the Monasca team, During the 2025.1 cycle, we were unable to dedicate the 
necessary focus to Monasca as much as we had hoped. However, in the upcoming cycle, 
I am fully committed to prioritizing Monascaâ€™s stability and improvement, ensuring that 
we address critical tasks with full focus and dedication.

In the new cycle, I would like to continue serving this project
and aim to make the project more stable and reliable and meet new requirements

There are some major works which still needs to do in new cycle:

1.Migration from Elasticsearch to Opensearch on the log management side
2.Update monasca integrations in other projects
3.Make Monasca stable and reliable

Thank you for your support,
I will do my best in the new cycle.
