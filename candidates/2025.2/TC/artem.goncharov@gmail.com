Hi everyone!

I would like to declare my candidacy for the Technical Committee.

I serve currently on TC and would like to continue doing so to ensure user and
usability voices are being heard. You know me already as a person standing for
user experience, and there is lot of space for improvement. This is my goal.

Thanks,

Artem
