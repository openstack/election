Hi there,

I want to propose myself to the Vitrage PTL role to keep looking after the
project one more time.

Despite my time constraints have not shifted in any direction, I still think
that project is a valuable asset in OpenStack services portfolio and should be
kept around. Main focus, alike to previous cycles, will be:

* Keeping CI jobs in adequate state
* Review incoming patches and gain interest in project amoung community
* Take care of project releasing
* Implement community goals
