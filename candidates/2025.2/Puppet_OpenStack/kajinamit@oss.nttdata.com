Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for Puppet OpenStack PLT for the 2025.2 cycle
to continue my PTL role.

Unfortunately we don't have many plans for active development now due to
the small team, but I'd propose that we focus the following items during
the next cycle.

 - Keep our CI healthy. This has been our top priotity.

 - Improve stability of Ubuntu 24.04 support and Puppet 8 support we are adding
   this cycle.

 - Work on adoption to CentOS Stream 10

 - Continue modernization on base-effort basis

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
