Hi All,


Here I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets during the 2025.5
cycle.

We don't have active feature development plan now, but our focus remains in
keeping storlets compatible with the latest swift. Eventlet removal is one
of the items we may have to prioritize during the next cycle.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
