Hey everyone!

This cycle I want to self-nominate again for the role of PTL
for the OpenStack-Ansible project during the 2025.2 (Flamingo) cycle.

Last cycle along with regular activities on using fresh/latest versions
of software, we had a really good progress on improving our CI testing
by implementing Molecule scenarios for some roles. This should not only
improve stability of roles, but also ensure better development experience.

So this cycle I want to push this effort forward and provide a common and
convenient approach for local test of roles with help of Ansible Development
Environment.

With that staying on top of supported platforms and software is always a
priority, as well as gradually improving performance and supported use-cases.

Thank you for your consideration!
