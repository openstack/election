I'd like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for 2025.2 cycle.

I have been PTL for the last seven cycles (Y-E), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.
We've landed some important new features like default to ProxySQL,
a lot of OVN and RabbitMQ improvements and continue to provide
a healthy and battle-tested deployment project.
We have greatly improved multinode CI stability and delivered a lot of
quality of operator life improvements.
The community around Kolla, Kolla-Ansible and Kayobe looks healthy and new
contributors are getting the required support - although as always we're
working on expanding the core reviewers team.

I'd like to focus on mentoring candidates for core reviewers, extending
CI coverage and better communication with community.
