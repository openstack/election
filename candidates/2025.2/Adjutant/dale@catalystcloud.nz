Hello,

I would like to nominate myself for candidancy for Adjutant PTL for the 2025.2 cycle.

We use this project extensively at Catalyst Cloud and I was an original contributor and reviewer to the project in its early years(2016).

I have been PTL for this project for the last 5 cycles and I will continue to keep this project functional and relevant to those using it.


Thank you for your consideration,

Dale Smith
Catalyst Cloud
