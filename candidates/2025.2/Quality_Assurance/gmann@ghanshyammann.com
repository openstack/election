Hello everyone,

I would like to propose my candidacy for the 2025.2 cycle QA PTL role.
I have served as QA PTL in the past for many cycles and trying my best to
keep up with the QA activities required for the development cycle.

I will also take this cycle an opportunity to mentor some other contributors
who can help us with QA maintenance?
