Hi everyone!

I want to suggest my candidacy for PTL of the OpenStack-Ansible project in the
Yoga cycle.

My main focus as PTL for the upcoming release would be:

* Do Yoga release without huge delay, so prefer releasing time instead of some
  new features
* Keep roles relevant and reliable
* Look for candidates for core reviewers role
