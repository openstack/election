I would like to serve as the Cyborg PTL in the Yoga cycle.

I was going to attempt to enumerate some sort of grand vision for Cyborg and
our priorities for the next cycle. As I thought about it, though, I realized
these remain largely the same as they always have been: provide a reliable,
scalable, and efficient hardware-accelerated device management platform.
In the past, we have added support for GPU, FPGA, NVMe SSD, and will add
support for AEP, SPDK and other devices in the future.

In order to increase the ability to interact with the VM, we completed the
feature of nova-cyborg interaction in Ussuri release. The exact details of
how we do that may vary somewhat from cycle to cycle, and I was completed the
support of nova rebuild/evacuate server and shelve/unshelve in the last two
releases, which greatly improved the convenience of user operations.

The log management project (Venus) team and I have completed the integration
of Venus to Cyborg. We can use Venus to quickly retrieve Cyborg logs, shorten
the problem location time, etc., so as to improve the efficiency of the Cyborg
project. In the future, I will have in-depth exchanges with the Venus
development team to continue to enhance this feature.

I'll do what I can to help, both directly (by improving Cyborg) and indirectly
(by, for example, fixing broken gate jobs and flaky tests).

Thanks & Best Regards,
Brin Zhang (brinzhang)
