Hi All,


I'd like to announce my candidacy to continue the PTL role for Storlets project
in the Yoga cycle.

After inactive recent cycles, we fortunately got some interest around
the project again.
So I'll propose the items below as our focus during the next cycle.
 - Keep compatibility with Swift. This is always top-priority
 - Merge some patches still open to achieve easier operation and improve
   resource efficiency

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
