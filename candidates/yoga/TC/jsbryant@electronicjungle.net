Hello OpenStack Community!

I would like to announce my candidacy for another term on the
Technical Committee.

First of all, I have appreciated the opportunity to serve on
the TC for the last two years.  I have endeavored to use this
time to get to know the broader community better and have also tried
to better understand the role and activities of the TC.

With this experience under my belt I would like to continue
to work with the TC in the coming year to address some of the
challenges that currently face the community.  Most importantly
the challenge of getting more new companies and contributors
to engage with the OpenStack community.  I also would like to
continue to work with the TC to innovate and improve OpenStack's
processes given the always changing landscape of the community.

I appreciate you all taking the time to read/consider my
candidacy!

Sincerely,
Jay Bryant (jungleboyj)
