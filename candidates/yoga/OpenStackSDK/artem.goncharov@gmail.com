Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

Big bunch of preparation work for R1.0 has been implemented. There are few
things remaining and we can finally celebrate. Please help me complete this
work and drive SDK/CLI further for wider adoption and better usability.

Thanks!
Artem
