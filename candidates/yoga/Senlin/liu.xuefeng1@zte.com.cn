Hi all,

This is my candidacy to continue my work as the Senlin PTL for the Yoga cycle.

In past several cycles, we finished many features, testing and bug fixing works.
For example:
 * Kubernetes: Added dependency relationship between the master cluster and the
   worker cluster created for Kubernetes.
 * Docker driver: Supported update name operation for docker profile.
 * Nova server: Added operation support to migrate a nova server node.
 * Health check improve: Added a new detection type that actively pools the node
   health using a URL specified in the health policy.
 * Split Senlin-Engine service into three services to make the engine more
   resilent.
 * OpenStack-wide Goals: Deprecate the JSON formatted policy file.
 * Testing: API/Function/Integration test were moved to senlin-tempest-plugin.

As a PTL in Yoga cycle, I'd like to continue to focus on the tasks as follows:
 * Continuous improvement of documents.
 * Actively monitor incoming bug reports and assigned to fix them.
 * Acknowledgment of OpenStack-wide Goals.
 * Release version Y on schedule.

Thanks for taking the time to read through this Roadmap and to consider my
candidacy.

Best Regards,
XueFeng
