Hello OpenStack community,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Designate for the Yoga
cycle.

I would like to continue to support the Designate team for the Yoga release.
We have made good progress improving the Designate tempest tests and
documentation, but we have more work to do. I am also excited to see progress
on new features.

Thank you for your support and your consideration for Yoga,

Michael Johnson (johnsom)
