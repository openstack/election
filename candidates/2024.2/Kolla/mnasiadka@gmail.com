I'd like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for 2024.2 cycle.

I have been PTL for the last five` cycles (Y, Z, A, B, C), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.
We've successfully implemented some major features that were long in the
review queue - like Let's Encrypt support and Podman.
The community around Kolla, Kolla-Ansible and Kayobe looks healthy and new
contributors are getting the required support - although as always we're
working on expanding the core reviewers team.
I've seen very positive feedback on the last OpenStack Summit (especially
on the Kolla User Forum session).

I'd like to focus on further extending the core reviewers team and
continuing to improve user/operator experience.
