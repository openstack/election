Hello,

I would like to propose my candidacy for Barbican PTL in the 2024.2 cycle. I've been the PTL since Antelope and I would like to continue to contribute in this role. As in theÂ past cycles, I will continue to focus on Barbican maintenance and stability.

Thanks you for your consideration,
Grzegorz Grasza (xek)
