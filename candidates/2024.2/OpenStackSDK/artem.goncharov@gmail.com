Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

Implementation of the code generator building OpenAPI specs from service source
code, Rust SDK, new experimental Rust CLI are now available. With this also a
rework on simplifying OpenStackSDK itself can be also started. The motto
remains same: make maintenance easier and less error prone.

I would like to continue working on this initiative and bring it to the end
making it an official deliveries of the OpenStack.

Thanks!
Artem
