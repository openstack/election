I would like to nominate myself for candidancy for Adjutant PTL.

We use this project extensively at Catalyst Cloud and I was an original contributor and reviewer to the project in its early years(2016).

I have been PTL for this project in the Antelope, Bobcat and Caracal cycles and I will continue to keep this project functional and relevant to those using it.


Thank you for your consideration,

Dale Smith
