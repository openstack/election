Hi,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Octavia PTL for the Dalmatian release.
I have been PTL since the Xena cycle and I want to continue to contribute to
this role.

For Dalmatian I would like that we continue our progress on new features such as
Active/Active support with BGP, Amphora/Load balancer resizing...

Thanks for your consideration,

Gregory Thiemonge (gthiemonge)
