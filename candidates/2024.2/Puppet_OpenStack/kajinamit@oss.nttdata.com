Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for Puppet OpenStack PLT during 2024.2 cycle,
to continue my role in the next cycle.

Here I'd like to list up some points we may focus during the next cycle.

 - Keep our CI healthy

 - Catch up with the changes made in services and libraries

 - Support new operating system versions like Ubuntu 24.04

 - Watch status of the projects and retire modules for inactive services so
   that we can properly focus on important modules with our limited capasity.

 - Continue modernization on base-effort basis

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
