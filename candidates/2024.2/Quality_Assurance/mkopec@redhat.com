Hi everyone,

I would like to propose my candidacy and continue serving as Quality Assurance
PTL in the 2024.2 cycle. I've been PTL for this project since Xena release.

I'm gonna continue addressing any requests and keeping things afloat.

I would like to thank all the contributors, core reviewers, and anyone
involved in any QA project, maintaining of the projects would simply not be
possible without you.

Thanks for your consideration!
