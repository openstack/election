Fellow Ironicers,

I'd like to submit my candidacy to serve as Ironic PTL for 2024.2

After 5 amazing years spent as core reviewer for the Ironic project
I'd be more than honored to help further the Ironic community through
the dalmatian cycle as my first experience as PTL.

Thank you,
Riccardo Pittau
