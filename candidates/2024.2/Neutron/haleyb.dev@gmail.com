Hello Openstack Community,

I am writing to submit my candidacy for the Neutron PTL position
during the 2024.2 cycle, continuing in my role from the 2024.1 cycle.

A lot of my priorities as PTL are the same as the 2024.1 cycle:

* Always make sure the stable branches are consumable downstream.
  With the introduction of unmaintained branches, the community has
  extended the lifecycle in a new direction. As a member of the
  downstream community that relies on these branches, I will continue
  to dedicate part of my time to reviewing backports and keeping them
  maintained.

* Continue pursuing CI stability.

* Keep working on ongoing specs. We did a good job of getting some of
  the larger specs done this cycle, but there are still a few in our
  review pipeline. I would set a goal to get these completed next cycle
  if they fail to make 2024.1:
** Active-active L3 Gateway with Multihoming (LP #2002687)
** Multiple back-end support for L3 routers in ML2/OVN (LP #2020823)

* Reduce the bug backlog. Over the past cycle we were able to keep
  our bug backlog constant through the continued great work of a lot
  of contributors. Having a reduction, either through verification
  or bug fixes, would be one of my goals.

* Making sure we are good stewards of gate resources.

* Always welcome new contributors.

Thanks for your support.
