Hello folks!

I to self-nominate for the role of PTL of OpenStack-Ansible during
the 2024.2 (Dalmatian) cycle.

For this cycle I want to focus on the following topics:
* Having support of recently released version of Operating Systems
* Keep up with latest supported versions of infrastructure software
* Promote the project on various events and ensure project compatibiltiy with various vendors
* Perform clean-up of old functional testing and test repo and finally have a progress on re-implementing
  functional testing of various scenarios for individual repositories.

Thank you for your consideration!
