Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Magnum PTL for the 2024.2 Cycle.

I have been the PTL since the Antelope Cycle. During the Caracal cycle, the team
has achieved the following:

* Improved CI and reintroduced testing on fedora_coreos_v1

* Drop Swarm COE.

* Drop Fedora Ironic driver

* Improved driver discovery code

For the 2024.2 cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Support the team to merge the ClusterAPI driver for Magnum. This is a big
  change and critical for Magnum's continued relevancy.

* Continue clean up on the documentation.

Regards,
Jake
