Hi All,


Here I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets during the upcoming
2024.2 cycle.

Altough our team is very small, we managed to introduce a few new features like
resource limits as well as CentOS 9 Stream CI job to improve user experience.
This cycle I'd like to propose a few remaining work items like podman support,
to continue the improvement.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
