Hi,

I'd like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for the Xena cycle.

I have been PTL for the last 4 cycles, and would like the opportunity to
continue to lead the team. Overall I think that the project is moving in the
right direction. Some things that I think we should focus on in the next cycle
are:

* remove our dependency on Dockerhub in CI testing to avoid pull limits
* improve the documentation
* expand the core team

Thanks for reading,
Mark Goddard (mgoddard)
