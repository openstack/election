Hi,

I'd like to announce my candidacy, continuing as Winstackers PTL for the
upcoming Xena cycle.

During the last release, we managed to add Hyper-V RBD support, which was one
of the most anticipated features.

In the upcoming cycle, we'll focus on stability and documentation improvements.
Another goal is to continue advocating OpenStack in the Windows world,
improving the integration with other projects.

Thank you for your consideration,

Lucian Petrut
