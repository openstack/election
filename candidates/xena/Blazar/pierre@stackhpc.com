Hi,

I would like to self-nominate for the role of PTL of Blazar for the Xena
release cycle. I have been PTL since the Stein cycle and I am willing to
continue in this role.

I will keep working with existing contributors to maintain the Blazar software
for their use cases and encourage the addition of new functionalities.

Thank you for your support,
Pierre Riteau (priteau)
