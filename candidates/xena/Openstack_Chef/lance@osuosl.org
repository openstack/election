Hello,

I am hereby announcing my candidancy as OpenStack Chef PTL for the
Xena release cycle.

Over the past year we have made a lot of progress on cleaning up and
improving OpenStack Chef both in testing and functionality.

My goals for the coming release cycle:

- Release cookbooks for the Train release
- Add support for CentOS 8
- Get cookbooks updated to support Ussuri, Victoria, Wallaby and Xena releases
- Start migrating cookbooks to be more resource driven similar to Sous
  Chefs cookbooks and move away from using attributes (where possible).

Thanks-

Lance Albertson (ramereth)
