Hello OpenStack community,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Designate for the Xena
cycle.

The Wallaby release cycle seems like it went by very quickly and I would
like to continue to support the Designate team during the Xena release.

Thank you for your support and your consideration for Xena,

Michael Johnson (johnsom)
