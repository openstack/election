Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

This cycle we are getting closer to the R1.0, there are some things still open
to be cleaned up. We also work on getting auth caching and fixing MFA loging.
OpenStackClient is also not lacking attention and got some improvements closing
gaps to python-novaclient and parts of that being switched to SDK.

I would love to keep helping moving us further and getting things implemented
in the most effective way.

Thanks!
Artem
