I intend to continue serving as Swift PTL.

I was going to attempt to enumerate some sort of grand vision for Swift and our
priorities for the next cycle. As I thought about it, though, I realized these
remain largely the same as they always have been: provide durable, scalable
storage for diverse use-cases without the need for specialized hardware and in
a way that allows both users and operators to be successful. In short, we will
continue to deliver the best object storage we can.

The exact details of how we do that may vary somewhat from cycle to cycle. The
last six months we've seen a lot of polishing of operational features, notably
container sharding and shrinking, part power increases, and error detection.
We'll likely continue working in these areas, and expand into larger
replication improvements.

I'll do what I can to help, both directly (by improving Swift) and indirectly
(by, for example, fixing broken gate jobs and flaky tests).
