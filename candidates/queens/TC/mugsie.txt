I would like to submit my candidacy for the Technical Committee for the
upcoming election.

I have been contributing to OpenStack since the Havana cycle [1], mainly in
Designate. I have also sporadically gotten involved with the TC, and its
meetings since Designate applied for incubation all the way back in Atlanta.

I have been PTL for Designate for Mitaka, Newton, Ocata and the Queens cycle,
and a core for a longer period. I was also PTL for the Global Load Balancing
before it was an unfortunate early casualty of the recent reshuffling within
sponsoring organizations in the community.

As part of previous projects, I was both a developer and a heavy user of
OpenStack. As part of contributing to the Kubernetes OpenStack integration
we ran into a lot of the problems that impact our users, and people who
try to integrate with us.

I believe that we all ready have a great base structure in place to help
OpenStack evolve, and part of that is too have a group of people from different
companies, backgrounds, genders and cultures to drive the project in the
Technical Committee.

I believe my experience working in a younger, smaller project within
OpenStack is a benefit, along with the experience of working on software as an
end user of OpenStack I can help us ensure the Technical Committee is mindful
of the unique challenges these projects and users can face.

I have not traditionally been shy about broaching these topics in the past [2]
[3][4], but I feel it is time I started follow through, and help guide the
resolution for these questions, and I now have an employeer who is supportive
of me spending more time in the community.

I do really like this community, and I want us to grow, expand and evolve the
software we write, without changing what we stand for.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
