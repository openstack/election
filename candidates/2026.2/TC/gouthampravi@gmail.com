Hello Stackers,

I am submitting my candidacy for another term on the OpenStack
Technical Committee. It's been two years since I was first elected,
and I've served as TC Chair during this time. In these past two
years, we've gotten some important things done: the CLA-to-DCO
transition that our community asked for over a decade ago,
extending the VMT's mandate to all project teams, setting clear
expectations around project retirements and governance transitions,
and consolidating our governance repositories. I'm proud of this work,
and I'm running again because there's more to do.

One thing that has become clear to me as Chair is that the people who
keep OpenStack running by fixing gates, reviewing code across projects,
reporting and triaging bugs, maintaining infrastructure and other myriad
things don't get enough recognition for it. I'm hoping to change that by
creating an objective, tangible way to acknowledge valuable contributions
and enthuse our community to do more of this work. We are one of the
largest open source projects in the world, and the community that's
responsible for it is a bedrock needs constant care.

I also want the TC to stay engaged with where cloud infrastructure
is headed. OpenStack should be the free and open source choice for
Sovereign Clouds and AI workloads. We'd do this not by chasing trends,
but by ensuring our project teams are equipped and positioned
for these use cases as they mature.

On the governance side, I'll keep working to eliminate bottlenecks
that slow our project teams down while maintaining the consistent
maintenance model that has made our successful projects sustainable.
The Technical Vision for OpenStack Clouds hasn't been modified
in a while, and I'd like to help draft its next iteration. I'll
take the opportunity to also include a process for evolving it.

Lastly, two years on the TC have shown me how much we benefit from
experienced, engaged leaders across our projects. I want to build
mentoring pathways for future TC members, so our leadership
pipeline is as durable as the software we produce.

Thank you for your consideration.
