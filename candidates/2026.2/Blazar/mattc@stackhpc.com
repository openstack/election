Hi all,

I'd like to put myself up for nomination as the PTL of Blazar for the
2026.2 release cycle.

I was the PTL for the 2025.2 cycle, and have been the release liason
and sharing the PTL responsibilities for 2026.1. I would like to pick
up the mantle of PTL again for the next cycle, to continue working to
improve and maintain the Blazar project.

Thank you for your consideration,
Matt Crees (mattcrees on IRC)
