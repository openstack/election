Hello,


I'd like to nominate myself as PTL in Heat project for the 2026.2 cycle.

I've been the Heat PTL since the 2024.1 cycle and has been focusing on
improving the project maintenance and stability. This cycle I propose
continuing our focus on stability improvement and alignment with the global
direction of OpenStack.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
