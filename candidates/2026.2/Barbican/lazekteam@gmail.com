Hello guys,

This cycle I want to nominate for the role of PTL
for the Barbican project during the 2026.2 (Hibiscus) cycle.

I will keep working with existing contributors to maintain Barbican for their use cases and encourage the addition of new functionalities.

And also helping new contributors in this project.

Thank you for your consideration.
