Hello,

After serving as PTL for Flamingo and Gazpacho, I would like to announce my
candidacy for the 2026.2 (Hibiscus) Nova and Placement PTL role.

The previous cycle was somewhat unusual, as upstream contributions from
several core contributors were impacted by internal changes within their
organizations. Despite this, the community stayed engaged and resilient,
and I am grateful for everyone who kept things moving forward.

The Eventlet removal effort, which started earlier and significantly
progressed during Flamingo and Gazpacho, should reach completion this cycle.
This will be an important milestone and will allow us to introduce new
changes more confidently.

In 2026.2, I would like to focus on enabling forward-looking work such as
confidential computing improvements, restarting collaboration with Manila
around virtiofs, and further I/O performance improvements. The concrete
priorities and scope of these efforts will be discussed and refined during
the next PTG. In parallel, I will continue to improve review efficiency and
maintain a welcoming and focused community.

My goal remains simple: keep Nova and Placement robust, maintainable, and
aligned with our users’ needs.

I would be honored to continue serving in this role.

Thanks,
René
