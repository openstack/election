Hello OpenStack community,

I would like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Designate for the
2026.2 cycle.

I've been a Designate contributor for 2 years and served as PTL
and core reviewer from the 2025.2 cycle.

My focus for the 2026.2 cycle will be to reduce the open bugs and
improve the overall stability and reliability of Designate.

Thank you for your support and your consideration for 2026.2,

Omer Schwartz (oschwart)
