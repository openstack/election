Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for Puppet OpenStack PLT for the upcoming
2026.2 cycle.

Unfortunately the project is becoming more inactive these days due to
constraints caused by the inactive upstream community (triggered by downstream=
first puppet community). While we still watch the situation to find out
a good migration path for us, we may decide a bit more long-term plan to keep
the project maintenance alive. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
