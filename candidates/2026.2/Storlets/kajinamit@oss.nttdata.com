Hi All,


Here I'd like to nominate myself as PTL of Storlets during the 2026.2 cycle.

Although the project is not much active these days, stability improvement is
still the top priority for us. Also, we should catch up with the work started
within swift to get rid of eventlet so that storlets continues being functional
with the future releases of swift.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
