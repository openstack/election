Dear OpenStack Community,

I would like to announce my candidacy to become a member of the
OpenStack Technical Committee (TC).

I am currently a Principal DevOps Engineer at Mirantis,
the company behind many of OpenStack's success stories.
From 2012 to 2017, I was deeply involved in the development
of one of the most popular OpenStack deployment tools,
Fuel (now retired), and served as the Fuel PTL during the
Newton release cycle.

In addition, I have been serving as the PTL for OpenStack-Helm
since the Bobcat release, leading the project through the last
three release cycles.

As a member of the TC, I am eager to contribute to discussions
around CI, release management, deployment, and operations.
I believe that my understanding of both the challenges faced by
operators and the intricacies of OpenStack development practices
can bring valuable insights to these discussions.

Thank you for considering my candidacy.
