Dear OpenStack-Helm Community,

I am submitting my candidacy to continue as the PTL for the
OpenStack-Helm project for the 2025.1 release.

Here are some of the achievements during the 2024.2 cycle:

- Implemented a job for testing the migration from the OSH
  legacy Ceph charts to Rook (soon it will be improved even more).
- Introduced test jobs with two new CNI implementations: Flannel and Cilium.
- Enhanced user documentation to provide guidance on deploying
  OpenStack from public Helm repositories instead of OSH Git repositories.
- Updated TLS and umbrella jobs to run in a multi-node environment,
  aligning them with most other test jobs (except for the DPDK test job,
  which currently requires 32GB test nodes).
- Upgraded the Ubuntu version for some infrastructure images.
- Upgraded default versions for many components: K8s, Calico, Helm, Ceph, ES, Fluentd, etc.
- Finished migration to uWSGI for all major Openstack components.
- Fixed numerous minor issues and blockers.
- Successfully tested OSH with a Kubespray-managed Kubernetes cluster
  (the test job is in progress).

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the contributors,
including those who shared their experiences using OSH and provided
valuable suggestions for improvement in the projectâ€™s Slack chat.

It would be a honor to continue serving as PTL for OpenStack-Helm and
to keep driving its development forward.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Vladimir Kozhukalov
