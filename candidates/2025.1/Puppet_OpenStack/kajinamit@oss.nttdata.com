Hello,


I'd like to announce my candidacy for Puppet OpenStack PLT during the upcoming
2025.1 cycle. I've been PTL for this project since Zed cycle and I'm willing to
continue my role and help the project.

Our team is quite small and has limited development capability, so I'd propose
a few focus items so that we can effectively operate the project.

 - Keep our CI healthy. This has been our top priotity.

 - Catch up with the changes made in services and libraries

 - Complete transition to Ubuntu 24.04

 - Continue modernization on base-effort basis

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
