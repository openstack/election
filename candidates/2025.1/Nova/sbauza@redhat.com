Hey Nova and Placement folks,

Yet again, I'm asking you to put myself on the Nova and Placement PTL seat and
yet again, I'm proposing my name late in the election nomination timeframe as
I want to leave others the time to consider the position.

Challenges are still upfront. Our gate is still coughing every single day and
despite the excellent work that a very few awesome people did on stabilizing
and which helped improving the situation (kudos to those who will recognize
themselves), we are still urging to fix the most common patterns. As a PTL,
I'll ensure to keep the energy to chase those issues and identify them so as a
team we can fight them.

Another concern to me is the reviewing pace. While we're continuing to deliver
solid reviews on feature proposals and patches, our team isn't much evolving
and we need fresh blood. In order to be able to deliver things, we need to
ensure that we properly recognize those who dedicate a portion of their daytime
to help others by providing valuable feedback (and I stress on the fact that
this feedback *has to* be valuable in order to by worthy). As a PTL, I'll
continue to encourage people to express their thoughts and concerns into Gerrit
comments so that we are able to count on.

The last challenge I have to mention here is the release cadence. Next release
(2025.1 Epoxy) will be a non-skippable release but we need to ensure that all
things we merged on 2024.2 Dalmatian are told and explained to those who
wanted to skip it.

Again, I'll finish telling I'm open to mentor anyone who considers running for
the PTL seat next cycle (2025.2 F). Feel free to reach to me and I'll offer
my help for a smooth transition.

Thanks,
-Sylvain
