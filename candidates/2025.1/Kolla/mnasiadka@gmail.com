I'd like to nominate myself to serve as the Kolla PTL for 2025.1 cycle.

I have been PTL for the last six cycles (Y-D), and would like the
opportunity continue to lead the team.
We've landed some important new features and continue to support multiple
distributions and architectures in a healthy manner.
The community around Kolla, Kolla-Ansible and Kayobe looks healthy and new
contributors are getting the required support - although as always we're
working on expanding the core reviewers team.

I'd like to focus on improving the stability of CI, regular point releases
and better communication with community.
