Fellow Ironicers,

I'd like to submit my candidacy to serve as Ironic PTL for 2025.1

It's been not an easy task to lead the Ironic project through the
2024.2 development cycle as my first experience as PTL, but I hope
I can keep helping the Ironic community through the epoxy cycle
renewing my commitment as Project Team Lead.

Thank you,
Riccardo Pittau
