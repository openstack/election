Hi there,

I want to propose myself to the Vitrage PTL role to keep looking after the
project.

While I still do not have enough time for any feature development,
my plan is still to focus on the project vitals, like:

* Keeping CI jobs in adequate state
* Review incoming patches and gain interest in project amoung community
* Take care of project releasing
* Implement community goals
