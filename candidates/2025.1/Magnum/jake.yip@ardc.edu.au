Hi all,

I would like to announce my candidacy for Magnum PTL for the 2025.1 Cycle.

During the Dalmatian cycle, the team has been mostly working on bugfixes and
the ClusterAPI driver effort.

For the 2025.1 cycle, I would like to focus on the following:

* Work with Azimuth Cloud project on ClusterAPI driver.

* Create tests for ClusterAPI driver and helm charts.

* Keep the project alive by supporting users.

I hope you will consider my candidacy.

Regards,
Jake
