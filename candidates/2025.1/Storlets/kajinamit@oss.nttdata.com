Hi All,


Here I'd like to announce my candidacy for PTL of Storlets during the 2025.1
cycle to continue my role in the project.

Our main focus during this cycle is making sure that we adopt to the changes
in test runtimes such as python (python 3.12) or OS (Ubuntu 24.04) to support
smooth transitions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you,
Takashi
