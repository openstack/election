Hi everybody!

I'd like to run again for PTL of OpenStackSDK.

Implementation of the code generator building OpenAPI specs from service source
code, Rust SDK, Rust CLI, TUI are now available. The motto remains same: make
maintenance easier and less error prone.

I would like to continue working on this initiative and bring it to the end
making it an official deliveries of the OpenStack.

Thanks!
Artem
