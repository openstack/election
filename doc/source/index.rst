Election Officials

Officials in OpenStack technical elections are delegates of the OpenStack
Technical Committee, and follow a mostly automated :doc:`process` assisted by
continuous integration jobs. The TC is always looking for volunteers interested
in officiating future elections, so reach out to them if you would like to
help.

Our current election officials are:

* Andy McCrae (andymccr), andy dot mccrae at gmail dot com

#openstack-dev OFTC channel.


.. _Election system:

Election System
===============

Elections will be held using CIVS and a Condorcet algorithm
(Schulze/Beatpath/CSSD variant). Any tie will be broken using
Governance_TieBreaking_.


Electorate
==========

The electorate for this election are the Foundation individual members that
are also committers for one of the `official project teams`_ repositories over
the |Timeframe|.

The electorate is requested to confirm their email address in gerrit,
review.openstack.org > Settings > Contact Information > Preferred Email,
prior to |PreferredEmailDeadLine| so that the emailed ballots are mailed
to the correct email address.

The electorate is expected to abide by the following general resolution:
https://governance.openstack.org/resolutions/20140711-election-activities.html.


Candidates
==========

Any member of an election electorate can propose their candidacy for the same
election. Nominees propose their candidacy by submitting a text file to the
openstack/election repository. See documentation below.


.. _How to submit a candidacy:

How to submit a candidacy
=========================

Each candidate must nominate themselves for each elected position, and are
encouraged to submit their own candidacy to gerrit, although where
appropriate, others may submit a candidacy for those who have already
self-nominated by other means.

If you are not already familiar with OpenStack development workflow, see this
more detailed documentation:
https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Candidacies now need to be submitted as a text file to the openstack/election
repository. Here are the required steps:

* Clone the election repository:
  git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/election ; cd election
* Create a new file candidates/<cycle>/<project_name>/<email_address>
  containing the candidate statement.
* Commit the candidacy: git add candidates/<cycle>/*/*;
  git commit -m "Adding <your_name> candidacy for <project_name>"
* Submit your candidacy: git review

For example Dana Developer (ddev on IRC) would compose a platform in a file
named "candidates/newton/Nova/dana\@inconnu.org" to submit a Newton Nova PTL
candidacy.  The election webpage will display the candidacy as
"Dana Developer (ddev)" based on the IRC nick stored in Dana's foundation
member profile.

After the candidacy is submitted to gerrit, verification and approval will
be performed by elections officials, followed by an update to the approved
candidate list.
