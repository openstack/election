Subject: [all][elections][ptl] PTL {{ release }} cycle Election Voting Kickoff

Polls for PTL elections are now open and will remain open for you to
cast your vote until {{ election_end }}.

We are having elections for {{ list_of_elections }}.

If you are a Foundation individual member and had a commit in one of
the team's deliverable repositories[0] over the {{ time_frame }}
timeframe ({{ start_release }} to {{ end_release }}) then you are
eligible to vote. You should find your email with a link to the
Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS) page to cast your vote in
the inbox of your Gerrit preferred email[1].

What to do if you don't see the email and have a commit in at
least one of the projects having an election:
* due to a new CIVS policy, to get the email from poll supervisors,
    you must opt in to email communication
    opt in with your Gerrit email address at:
    https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/opt_in.pl
* eligible voters who opt in to email communication late
  can see a pending poll invitation and vote
  until {{ election_end }}.
* check the trash or spam folders of your Gerrit Preferred
    Email address, in case it went into trash or spam
* wait a bit and check again, in case your email server is a bit slow
* find the sha of at least one commit from the project's deliverable
    repos[0] and email the election officials.

If we can confirm that you are entitled to vote, we will add you
to the voters list for the appropriate election.

Our democratic process is important to the health of OpenStack,
please exercise your right to vote!

Candidate statements/platforms can be found linked to Candidate
