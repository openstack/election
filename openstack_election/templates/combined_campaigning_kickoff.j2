Subject: [all][elections][tc] TC Election Campaigning Kickoff

Developers,
    The TC Election Campaigning Period has now started[1].  During the next
couple days, you are all encouraged to ask the candidates questions about
their platforms[2], opinions on OpenStack, community governance, and anything
else that will help you to better determine how you will vote.  This is the
time to raise any issues you wish the future TC to consider, and to evaluate
the opinions of the nominees prior to their election.

Candidates,
    Each of you has posted a platform[2], and announced your nomination to
the developers.  From this point, you are encouraged to ask each other
questions about the posted platforms, and begin discussion of any points
that you feel are particularly important during the next cycle.  While you
are not yet TC members, your voices and opinions about the issues raised in
your platforms and questions raised by the wider community will help ensure
that the future TC has the widest possible input on the matters of community
concern, and the electorate has the best information to determine the ideal
TC composition to address these and other issues that may arise.
